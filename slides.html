## Setting up a working environment

For the setup instructions, see the [setup page](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-data-analysis/setup.html).

---
class: left, middle

1. Everyone has conda installed and the environment setup? If not, see [1-install-python-and-the-required-python-packages](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-data-analysis/setup.html#1-install-python-and-the-required-python-packages)
1. Make sure to (re)download ALL the course material, see [2-getting-the-course-materials](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-data-analysis/setup.html#2-getting-the-course-materials) also if you already did this before.
1. Next, also do section 3 and 4 of the [setup](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-data-analysis/setup.html) instructions.

> If you succesfully done 1, 2 and 3, put up your `green sticky note` on your computer screen.

Next:

- Surf to and fill in [the questionnaire](https://hackmd.io/d6wqmazERIyz__dlfwKq1w?both)
- In JupyterLab, start with the `notebooks/00-jupyter_introduction.ipynb` individually.

Installation or setup issues? Put up your `orange/red/yellow sticky note` on your computer screen.

---
class: center, middle

When you see something like this...


![:scale 100%](./img/startup.png)

...relax, you're ready to start!

---
class: middle, left

### Time is divided between

- group sessions: we explain new concepts (aka 'theory')
- practise sessions: you work on exercises

In case of questions, remarks, suggestions, you can always interrupt us and just ask.

During practise sessions, use the `orange/red/yellow sticky note` on top of your screen to let us know you have a question.

### Status check

We will regularly ask for a check (ready with exercise, installation succesfull...). Use the `green sticky note` on top of your laptop screen to say üëç.

### Feel lost?

Just ask either one of us, we are here to help you.

# Working with Python

---

# Conda

### Why using conda?

- Consistent package manager across Windows, Mac and Linux
- Many precompiled packages available
- Less problems with installation!

--

### Why different environments?

- Manage the dependencies of a specific project/paper/group/...
- You can install different version of Python and other packages alongside on your computer
- Easily share environments with other

---
## Small overview of conda commands

Creating a new environment:

```
conda create -n my_env python=3.7 pandas

# or from environment file
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activating an environment:

```
conda activate my_env
```

Install a new package:

```
conda install matplotlib     # if not working, try: pip install ...
```


List all installed packages: `conda list`

List all your environments: `conda info -e`

See the docs: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/index.html

---
class: center, middle

### Keep track of your python ecosystem <br>with an  `environment.yml`
<br><br>

```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

* [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Popular for web-development and Django applications, powerful when doing 'real' development (packages, libraries, software)
* [Eclipse + **pyDev plugin**](http://www.pydev.org/): If you like working in Eclipse, just add the python environment
* [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [**Atom**](https://atom.io/), ...

## Pandas: data analysis in python

For data-intensive work in Python the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) library has become essential.

What is `pandas`?

* Pandas can be thought of as *NumPy arrays with labels* for rows and columns, and better support for heterogeneous data types, but it's also much, much more than that.
* Pandas can also be thought of as `R`'s `data.frame` in Python.
* Powerful for working with missing data, working with time series data, for reading and writing your data, for reshaping, grouping, merging your data, ...

It's documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/

---

## When do you need pandas?

When working with **tabular or structured data** (like R dataframe, SQL table, Excel spreadsheet, ...):

- Import data
- Clean up messy data
- Explore data, gain insight into data
- Process and prepare your data for analysis
- Analyse your data (together with scikit-learn, statsmodels, ...)

---

## Attention!

Pandas is great for working with heterogeneous and tabular 1D/2D data, but not all types of data fit in such structures!

* When working with array data (e.g. images, numerical algorithms): just stick with numpy
* When working with multidimensional labeled data (e.g. climate data): have a look at [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)

---

## Key features

* Fast, easy and flexible input/output for a lot of different data formats
* Working with missing data (`.dropna()`, `pd.isnull()`)
* Merging and joining (`concat`, `join`)
* Grouping: `groupby` functionality
* Reshaping (`stack`, `pivot`)
* Powerful time series manipulation (resampling, timezones, ..)
* Easy plotting

### Reading advice

> "*However, while most scientists are careful to validate their laboratory and field equipment, most do not know how reliable their software is*"
